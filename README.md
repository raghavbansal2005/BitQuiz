# Usage
The best part of BitQuiz is that it requires no setup or instalation. All you need to do to use BitQuiz is go to the following [link](https://hidden-falls-37034.herokuapp.com/). Once there you need to create an account. Note that the username does have to be unique and so does the E-mail. The E-mail does not have to be real it just needs to follow and E-mail format. The default lenght of each test is 5 questions but can be changed in the seetings page which can be accessed by clicking your usernmae in the top right corner after logging in. All your tests are stored in a database so stats can be seen in the analytics page. The analytics page displays some graphs that show your score of your previous test as well as the distribution of all of the tests that you have taken. After each test a printable report is created which you can print by simply clicking ```ctrl + p```.
